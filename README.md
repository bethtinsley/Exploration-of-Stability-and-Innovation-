The analytical exploration of Stability and Innovation is split into three analyses: 
1) An analysis of the global (direct) relationship
2) An analysis of the national (direct) relationhsip) 
3) An analysis of the national (indirect) relationship -  split into two parts (the impact of stability on linking factors, and the impact of the linking factors on innovation)

Hence there are four MATLAB codes (analysis 3 has 2 parts). Each matlab code requires its corresponding database (either national or global).

Each MATLAB code has its own results database, where the results have been recorded and processed (with the exception of the National Direct results - this code was simple enough to view all results from the output of the code).
