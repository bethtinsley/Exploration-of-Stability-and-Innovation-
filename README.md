The analytical exploration of Stability and Innovation is split into three analyses: 
1) an analysis of the global (direct) relationship, 
2) the national (direct) relationhsip) 
3) the national (indirect) relationship -  split into two parts (the impact of stability on linking factors, and the impact of the linking factors on innovation). 
Hence there are four MATLAB codes. Each matlab code requires its corresponding database.
