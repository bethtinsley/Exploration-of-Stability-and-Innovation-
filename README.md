Stability and Innovation 

The analytical exploration of Stability and Innovation is split into 4 sections: 
1) An analysis of the global (direct) relationship
2) An analysis of the national (direct) relationhsip) 
3) An analysis of the national (indirect) relationship -  part 1: the impact of stability on linking factors
4) An analysis of the national (indirect) relationship -  part 2: the impact of the linking factors on innovation

Databases:
There are two databases - one national and one global.

Analysis:
There are four MATLAB codes. Each matlab code requires a database to run (either national or global).

Results:
Each MATLAB code has its own results database, where the results have been recorded and processed (with the exception of the National Direct results - this code was simple enough to view all results from the output of the code).

Model:
The indirect, national relationship has been modelled (including both parts).
